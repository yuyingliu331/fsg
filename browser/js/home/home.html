                <h4>Who are we?</h4>
                <p>We are but a simple company whose goal is to allow anyone to experience anything.</p>

                <h4>How do you create your memories?</h4>
                <p>Most of our memories are artificially created by a computer system guided by our artists, but for certain special requests, we harvest memories directly from the source.</p>

                <h4>Are there any side effects?</h4>
                <p>In certain cases, users of RAM may experience a loss of personal identity and a deep sense of unsettlement, as well as some nausea. However, most users have no side effects whatsoever.</p>

                <h4>How are memories ingested?</h4>
                <p>Users can choose their preferred method of synthesization; you can inject the memory directly into your arm, inhale it, smoke it, eat it, or bathe in it! See your checkout page (accessible through your cart) to see a full list of options.</p>

                <h4>This is weird. Why are you doing this?</h4>
                <p>Why not?</p>

                <h4>Can I suggest a memory for you to create?</h4>
                <p>Please stop emailing us. We know what you want, and it's sick.</p>
